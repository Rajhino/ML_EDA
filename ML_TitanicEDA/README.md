# Titanic DataSet
## Description
The above repo consistes of different types of ML algorithm.
In this project, the accuracy of the Titanic data set is measured using different alogrithms.

In this project there are two parts: Part1 & Part2
### Part1
It consists of the code required for Feature Engineering. Feature Engineering is a method which is processed so as to make sure that the data set which we are using doesn't contain any sort of unnecessary data. And hence, it is also known as cleaning of the data set.
### Part2
This part consists of the code where the dataset is gone through various types of ML algorithms to measure the accuracy. And we get the reqiured outcome.

## Result
To check which algo is the best one for Titanic data set, download the ZIP folder, open jupyter and execute the code sequentially.
Try and analyse the accuracy yourself. Anyhow, the solution is at the end of the code.

## Question(s)
